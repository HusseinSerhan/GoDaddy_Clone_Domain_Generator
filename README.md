# Random Domain Generator

This is a project that generates a random domain name using a combination of pronouns, adjectives, nouns and extensions. The project is separated into three files: `style.css`, `index.html`, and `app.js`.

## Project Files
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS code for the project.
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML code for the project.
- `app.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for the project.

## Arrays
The `app.js` file includes four arrays of pronouns, adjectives, nouns, and extensions. These arrays are used by the `generateRandomText()` function to generate a random domain.

## Functionality
The `app.js` file includes a `generateRandomText()` function that generates a random domain name using template literals and the `textContent` property. The `textContainer` and `generateBtn` variables use the `getElementById` method to generate the functionality behind the "generate random domain" button. The `addEventListener` and `bind` method are used to generate the random domain after the user clicks the button.

## Responsive Design
The website is fully responsive and can be viewed on different screen sizes, including Iphone SE, Iphone 12, Galaxy S22 Ultra, Ipad Air 4, and the Macbook Air, among others.

## Animations
The app includes a rain animation generated with CSS that replicates a Bladerunner atmosphere.

## Main Goal
The main goal of this project was to expose me to DOM methods like `addEventListener` and `getElementById`. In addition to practicing working with the DOM, I got exposure to media queries as I built the website to be responsive in screens of all size widths. Lastly, I got to use animations for the first time since I started working on web development.
